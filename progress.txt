## Key Fixes Made

**FIX 1**: Initially made mistake of replacing PIXI.js GameRenderer with emoji
placeholders. This has been FIXED - MobileCombatView now uses the real GameRenderer
component with actual sprites, monsters, backgrounds, and animations.

**FIX 2 - Sprites not visible**: The GameRenderer was using fixed pixel positions that
put sprites off-screen on small mobile canvases:
- groundY = canvasHeight - 200 → negative on 176px canvas!
- playerX = centerX - 200 → off-screen on narrow screens!

Fixed by making positions scale relative to canvas size:
- groundY = max(canvasHeight * 0.85, canvasHeight - 70)
- charSpacing = min(200, canvasWidth * 0.25)
- Added scaleFactor = min(1, canvasHeight / 400) for all elements

**FIX 3 - React Hook Error #310**: Caused by conditional return before all hooks.
Fixed by splitting GameLayout into router component and DesktopGameLayout component.

The canvas is displayed in a 176px height container with:
- Zone header above (name + currency)
- Controls below (Rest/Fight toggle + speed controls)
